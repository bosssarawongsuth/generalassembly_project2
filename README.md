### Problem Statement

This project comprises of the exploration of the exploration of the Housing Prices and the different features of the houses sold in Ames, Iowa. This will explore some important features that affect the sale price of the houses. Additionally, we will also be creating several machine learning models that can be used to predict the sale prices of the houses in Ames, Iowa based on the different features of the house. The models that we are comparing will include OLS Regression (no penalties) and Elastic Net (L1/L2 Penalty) to see how they affect the predictions we get.

The study and the models created from this model could potentially be used by real estate/property development firms that would like some insights into how to make the property more valuable and the price at which these properties could be advertised.

### Datasets

The project contains 2 usable datasets:

- [train.csv]('./datasets/train.csv') - 2051 rows, 81 columns
- [test.csv]('./datasets/train.csv') - 879 rows, 80 columns

The datasets contain categorical and numerical features for houses that were sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010.

The data dictionary can be found [here](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt).
